                    <h2>What is SagePath</h2>
                    <p>SagePath is a gamified learning platform designed for students and professionals who want to level up their skills through an engaging, adventurous journey.
                        Inspired by the world of quests and mentors, learners choose a course as their “path” and progress through modules like challenges in a fantasy realm.
                        Guided by the wise Sage mascot, users gain experience points (XP), evolve their companions, and collect badges by conquering various challenges such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Each step forward not only builds knowledge but also strengthens the learner’s journey,
                        transforming education into an interactive adventure where wisdom, growth, and mastery are rewarded.</p>
